# Assessment-of-Embodied-Energy-of-Buildings
Overall energy emitted in construction of buildings and structures
The assesment was done on a educational building
It is completely for educational and reaseach work
This project presents the overall energy emitted in construction of buildings and structures. A detailed report was generated on an educational institution building on Estimator software to estimate amount of building materials. This study also proved the small design element changes that can make a great difference in energy without affecting the strength and lifetime of structure hence keeping the environment safe.
